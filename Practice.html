        <h3>The Amazing Volley Shot</h3>
        <p>The amazing <em>volley shot</em> that was scored by me was a moment in my life that changed how I would play in the beautiful game of <em>soccer</em>. The ball was moving towards me fast, like a bullet. Instead of stopping it, I lifted my leg off the ground, struck the ball midair, and shot it with great power towards the goal, securing my team's win.</p>

        <h3>First Console Ever Bought</h3>
        <p>The first console I ever bought was the <em>Xbox 360</em>. While it wasn’t a <em>PlayStation</em>, I was a kid back then and didn’t know about the rivalry between PlayStation and Xbox. It lasted me a long time and provided great games that kept me entertained for years.</p>

        <h3>The Day I Bought Grand Theft Auto 5</h3>
        <p>One of the best games I ever bought was <em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em>, the first time I played it I was hooked to the game. Even though I was below the age limit to play the game, it did not stop anyone from buying it. Overall it's a great game and the <em>story</em> and the whole ecosystem of the game is great.</p>

        <h3>The 2020 Dumpster-Fire and Coronavirus</h3>
        <p><em>2020</em> was a challenging year for everyone. The <em>Pandemic</em> changed learning from in-person to <em>online learning</em>. It was a new and difficult experience, and being away from friends felt lonely. However, I spent more time with family and developed hobbies like reading and gaming to do something, since there was not a lot you could do.</p>

        <h3>2026 and Beyond</h3>
        <p>By 2026, I hope to complete my <em>CCNA certification</em> and start working in <em>IT networking</em>. From there, I want to get other certifications and, in the end, become a <em>network engineer</em>. I might also study in a medical field in college just as another skill to have with me.</p>
